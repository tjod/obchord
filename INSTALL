In order to install openchord, take the following steps.
You should either be logged in as root, or precede each of the commands with sudo.

$ make
$ make install

In order to use openchord and the ob.* functions, you must have the openbabel/python scripting language installed.
There is documentation about how to do this at http://openbabel.org/wiki/Python.
There may also be synatpics packages (Ubuntu/Debian) or rpm packages (Redhat/CentOS/Fedora/SuSE)
to make openbabel installation easier.

Then install openchord:
> python setup.py install

Next, install the openbabel.* SQL functions into a new database (e.g. obchord)
You must have the plpythonu language available in your installed postgres.
There are synaptics and rpm packages for this,
or if you compile postgres yourself, use the --with-python option.

$ createdb obchord
will create a database called obchord.

Next, install the functions into an existing database (obchord).
In order to install the openchord and ob.* function, you must have administrator
privileges for postgres.  If your username has enough postgres privilege
$ bash installdb obchord
otherwise login as a privileged postgres user or do something like this
$ sudo -u postgres bash installdb obchord

Now, you should be able to connect to obchord or your-db and do something like:
 select ob.cansmiles('c1ccccc1C(=O)NC');
and get the result
  obchord=#  select ob.cansmiles('c1ccccc1C(=O)NC');
     cansmiles    
 -----------------
  CNC(=O)c1ccccc1
 (1 row)
